            Starbucks Corporation is an American multinational chain of
            coffeehouses and roastery reserves headquartered in Seattle,
            Washington. It is the world's largest coffeehouse chain. As of
            November 2021, the company had 33,833 stores in 80 countries, 15,444
            of which were located in the United States. Out of Starbucks'
            U.S.-based stores, over 8,900 are company-operated, while the
            remainder are licensed. The rise of the second wave of coffee
            culture is generally attributed to Starbucks, which introduced a
            wider variety of coffee experiences. Starbucks serves hot and cold
            drinks, whole-bean coffee, micro-ground instant coffee, espresso,
            caffe latte, full and loose-leaf teas, juices, Frappuccino
            beverages, pastries, and snacks. Some offerings are seasonal, or
            specific to the locality of the store.

            <dt>Crispy Grilled Cheese on Sourdough</dt>
            <dd>
                A delicious blend of white Cheddar and mozzarella cheeses on
                sourdough bread, topped with a Parmesan butter spread.
            </dd>

            <dt>Chicken & Bacon on Brioche</dt>
            <dd>
                Herbed chicken is slow-cooked and piled high on toasted apple
                brioche, topped with our double-smoked bacon and maple mustard.
                Chickens are raised without the use of antibiotics.
            </dd>

            <dt>Turkey, Provolone & Pesto on Ciabatta</dt>
            <dd>
                Thick-sliced turkey and melted provolone cheese stacked on a
                ciabatta roll, then topped with our signature basil pesto and
                dry-roasted red peppers. So tasty, you'll want seconds, but so
                satisfying, you won't need them. Turkeys are raised without the
                use of antibiotics.
