# SSW-215 2022S Assignments

This is a collection of the assignments I am doing (did) for the SSW-215 class at Stevens Institute of Technology with Professor Oyeleke. 

If you are a future student going to take this class, the biggest resources I would recommend are:

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/) is probably the best documentation for everything HTML/CSS/Javscript that you will ever find on the web. It gives examples for everything, and it is the most up to date, as they follow the W3C standards. They also mark deprecated things as deprecated and give an opinionated stance on some features, which when learning anything is very good to have available to you.
- [MySQL Reference Manual](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/) is the best source for information about MySQL and SQL standards in general. Unless it is a very trivial thing you forgot or don't know how to do, nothing beats reading the actual documentation written by the people that wrote and maintain the software.
- [Web Dev Simplified YT Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/WebDevSimplified) is awesome. Kyle, the host, does a great job with talking about everything frontend. Great opinionated resource for beginners and more experienced people.
